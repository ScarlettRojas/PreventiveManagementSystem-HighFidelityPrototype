# Preventive Maintenance System (PMS) — High-Fidelity Prototype (Figma)

This repository stores the **Figma source file** (`.fig`) and basic folders for a Preventive Maintenance System (PMS) UI/UX. It focuses on clear, production-ready flows for maintenance teams, keeping the structure light so reviewers can access the design quickly.

## Quick Preview (Figma)
- Prototype (Figma): https://www.figma.com/proto/ofK8KrPCisx5QVNeVfGCx4/PMS?node-id=8-422&p=f&t=g7yOaPFHzkhEHS4N-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=8%3A422 
> Tip: Set your Figma link to **“Anyone with the link can view”** so recruiters can open it without requesting access.

## What’s Inside
- `design/figma/PMS-high-fidelity.fig` — Figma source file.
- `design/exports/` — *(optional)* exported assets (PNG/SVG/PDF) if needed.
- `design/screenshots/` — *(optional)* placeholder folder (unused here; no images committed).

## Scope & Key Flows
- **Assets & Equipment:** asset hierarchy, equipment profile, parts/spares.
- **Planning:** calendar, PM templates, service schedules.
- **Execution:** work-order creation/assignment, approvals, technician checklists (photos, notes, parts).
- **Monitoring:** simple KPI dashboards (MTBF/MTTR, backlog, compliance).
- **Alerts (baseline):** condition-based triggers (vibration/temperature/pressure), fault triage and notes.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Open the Figma prototype via the link above for the interactive experience.
2. If you need the source locally, download `design/figma/PMS-high-fidelity.fig` and open it in **Figma Desktop**.
3. Exports (if any) will live under `design/exports/` to keep the source clean.
